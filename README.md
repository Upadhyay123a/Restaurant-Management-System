# Restaurant-Management-System
The Restaurant Management System is a Spring Boot-based application that provides a set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing users, including Admin, Normal User, and Visitor, along with food items in a restaurant. The system enforces role-based access control, ensuring that each type of user has the appropriate privileges.
